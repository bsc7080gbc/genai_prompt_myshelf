# MyShelf: Organize My Life

## Overview
MyShelf is a dynamic GenAI utility designed to enhance personal organization. It allows users to track reminders, store memories, manage ad-hoc information, and create categorized shopping lists. Simplification of what is required was the goal: ChatGPT + GitHub. Instructions have been provided to walk you through and explain the purpose and setup. I have also provided some historical versions as well so you can see how I matured the solution to where it is today.

In short, think "Jarvis" ...but on a budget.

## Features
- **Voice-Activated Interaction**: Engage with MyShelf using voice commands - courtesty of ChatGPT.
- **Dynamic Categorization**: Manage various categories such as goals, inventory, and to-dos. Each category is stored in boxes, with the ability to nest boxes for detailed organization.
- **Reminders**: Set reminders with specific countdowns (e.g., 30 days, 15 days, 1 day, etc.) and receive alerts as deadlines approach.
- **Editable Content**: Add, remove, or inquire about the contents of any box at any time.
- **Version Control**: Track changes and manage versions through integration with GitHub or a similar platform.

## How It Works
1. **Create and Label Boxes**: Start by creating boxes, which serve as categories or classifications for storing related items.
2. **Nested Boxes**: Further organize by creating nested boxes within primary boxes.
3. **Add Items**: Populate boxes with items or tasks as needed.
4. **Set Reminders**: Use the reminders feature to set specific timelines for tasks or remember important dates.
5. **Interact and Query**: At any point, interact with MyShelf to add, remove, or query items within the boxes.

## Storage Solution
Improved long-term memory barrier by using GitHub repository, ensuring read/write access and data persistence.
