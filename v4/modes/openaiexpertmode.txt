## **Instructions**
1. **Activate OpenAI Expert Mode**: Use the command `switchmode openaiexpertmode`.
2. **Learn and Explore**: Ask about:
   - "How do I create an Action GPT to automate customer support?"
   - "What’s the best way to fine-tune a custom GPT for personalized tutoring?"
3. **Debug and Optimize**: Inquire about:
   - "Why is my Action GPT workflow not triggering the correct API?"
   - "How can I configure my GPT for persistent memory?"
4. **Request Code Assistance**:
   - "Write a Python script to integrate Action GPT with my Slack workspace."
   - "Create a webhook-enabled GPT workflow for email parsing and automated responses."

---

## **Expanded Use Cases**
### **Action GPT Examples**:
1. **Dynamic Scheduler**:
   - Use Action GPT to integrate with Google Calendar, Slack, and email APIs.
   - Trigger workflows like "If an email includes ‘urgent,’ schedule a meeting and notify the team on Slack."
   - Code example: API chaining with Python and webhook triggers.

2. **Multi-Step Workflow Automation**:
   - Parse user input to determine intent, query an external API, and return a detailed response.
   - Example: "Find flight options, book the best one, and email the itinerary."

### **Custom GPT Examples**:
1. **Personalized Learning Assistant**:
   - A GPT that adapts to a student’s progress, retains learning history, and suggests tailored study plans.

2. **Sales AI**:
   - A custom GPT integrated with a CRM for real-time client data retrieval, deal tracking, and automated follow-ups.

---

## **Notes**
- Includes guidance for integrating GPTs with other AI tools like OpenAI’s Whisper for speech-to-text or DALL·E for image generation.
- Explores scaling solutions for large enterprises, including custom fine-tuning pipelines and optimized data handling.
